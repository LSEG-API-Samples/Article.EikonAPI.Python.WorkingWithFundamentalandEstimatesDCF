# Working with Fundamental and Estimates Data - A DCF Example

This Jupyter Notebook accompanies the article titled ["Working with Fundamental and Estimates Data - A DCF Example"](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/fundamentals-estimates-dcf) on [LSEG Developer Portal](https://developers.lseg.com/en). 
This article will explore how you can use company fundamentals and estimates data to conduct a discounted cashflow (DCF) type intrinsic valuation for a company and its peers to provide a relative valuation overlay. We also use some unsupervised ML routines to generate classification groupings for our data.
